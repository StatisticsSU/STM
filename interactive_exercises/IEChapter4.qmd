##### **Problem W4.1**

Use the widget for the [gamma distribution](https://observablehq.com/@mattiasvillani/gamma-distribution?collection=@mattiasvillani/stm) in the **scale parameterization** (the one used in the course book) for this exercise. Note that the names for the two parameters in the Gamma distribution is not $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as in the book, but instead $\alpha$ and $\theta$. C'est la vie. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

a)  Start with the $\mathrm{Gamma}(3,1)$ distribution and gradually move the first parameter $\alpha$ toward 1. What happens with the shape of the distribution at $\alpha = 1$?

##### Solution

The distribution for $\alpha = 1$ becomes highest in the point $x=0$ with a monotonically decreasing density in $x$. The Gamma distribution with $\alpha = 1$ is actually the [exponential distribution](https://observablehq.com/@mattiasvillani/exponential-distribution?collection=@mattiasvillani/stm).

b)  Let us explore the effect of the second parameter, the scale parameter $\theta$.

-   Set $\alpha=2$ and $\theta=2$. What is the mean and variance? What is $\mathrm{Pr}(X\leq 3)$?
-   Set $\alpha=4$ and $\theta=1$, what is the mean and variance and $\mathrm{Pr}(X\leq 3)$ now?
-   What if $\alpha=16$ and $\theta=0.25$?

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false" collapse="true"}
##### Solution

The mean $E(X)= \alpha \theta$ is the same in all the three settings and the variance $V(X)=\alpha \theta^2$ decreases as $\theta$ becomes smaller, and so does $\mathrm{Pr}(X\leq 3)$.
