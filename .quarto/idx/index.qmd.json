The objective is to provide the probability, statistical theory and modeling needed to follow the Bayesian Learning course.\n\n### Contents\n\n-   **Mathematical methods**: derivatives, integrals, optimization, numerical optimization, vectors and matrices.\n\n-   **Probability theory**: discrete and continuous stochastic variables, density and probability functions, distribution functions, multivariate distributions, multivariate normal distribution, marginal distributions, conditional distributions, independence, expected value, variance, and covariance, functions of stochastic variables, sampling distributions, law of large numbers, central limit theorem.\n\n-   **Modelling and prediction**: linear and non-linear regression, dummy variables and interactions, model selection, cross-validation, overfitting, regularization, classification, logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, Poisson regression.\n\n-   **Inference**: point estimation, bias-variance trade-off, maximum likelihood (ML), likelihood theory, numerical optimization for ML estimation, bootstrap.\n\n-   **Time series**: trend and seasonality, autocorrelation, autoregressive models.\n\n### Literature\n\n-   Authors (2021). [Book Name](misc/larry.png)\n-   Additional material and handouts distributed during the course.\n\n### Structure\n\nThe course consists of [lectures](lectures.qmd), [mathematical exercises](exercises.qmd) and [computer labs](computerlabs.qmd). See the formal course plan.\n\n### Examination\n\nThe course is examined by a\n\n-   written exam (grades A-F)\n-   [home assignment](homeassignment.qmd) (grade pass/fail).\n\n### Schedule\n\nThe course schedule can be found on [TimeEdit](https://cloud.timeedit.net/su/web/stud1/s.html?tab=3&object=cevt_39063_VT2025&startDate=20250222&endDate=20250913&type=courseevent&h=t). A tip is to select *Subscribe* in the upper right corner of TimeEdit and then paste the link into your phone's calendar program.\n\n### Formula cheet sheets\n\n### Interactive material\n\nThe course makes heavy use of interactive Observable notebooks in javascript that runs in your browser. The widgets will be linked below each relevant lecture.
