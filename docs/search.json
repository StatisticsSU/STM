    "text": "In this tutorial you will learn how maximum likelihood estimates and standard errors can be computed by numerical optimization routines in R. We learn about a general way to compute a normal approximation of the sampling distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator, which can be proved to be accurate in large samples, but is typically surprisingly accurate also for smaller sample sizes.\n\nIt will take some work to get to the end of the document, but by the end of it you will have learned invaluable tools for a statistician/data scientist/machine learner giving you the super-power ðŸ’ª to use the computer to estimate the parameters and their uncertainty in quite complex models.\nWe will start with simple models with a single parameter to cover all the concepts, and then move on to the practically more important multi-parameter case.\nLetâ€™s first load some useful libraries (install them using install.packages() if you havenâ€™t already).\n\nlibrary(latex2exp) # for plotting mathematical symbols (LaTeX)\nlibrary(remotes)   # for loading packages from GitHub\nlibrary(ggplot2)   # for fancy plotting\nlibrary(mvtnorm)   # the multivariate normal distribution"

This average probability will not become tiny when we look at more and more observations, it remains interpretable. The usual arithmetic mean\n\\[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_ {i=1}^n P(y_i \\vert \\lambda)\\]\nis not so great for averaging probabilities, however.
